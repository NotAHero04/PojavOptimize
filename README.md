# PojavOptimize
Welcome to PojavOptimize, a modpack that can boost the performance of PojavLauncher...

# ...but wait, why did you make a separate repository for it?
That's because I'll maintain two variants of the modpack.
- The first is now called PojavOptimize: Original, well it's just your familiar modpack that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavOptimize).
- The second modpack is under the temporary name "apple", but I already have an official name for it, just wait for the final product to be done.

# Okay, so are both versions maintained in this repository?
Sure.

# Which versions are supported?
- PojavOptimize: Original currently supports Minecraft 1.16.x and 1.17.x.
- PojavOptimize "apple" is under construction, and you will see it come out for Minecraft 1.18.1/1.18.2.

PojavOptimize: Original for Minecraft 1.18.x will be a subset of "apple". That's what you know, for now.

# Which mods are currently/will be added in PojavOptimize?
- For 1.16.5, see [this](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavOptimize)
- For 1.17.1, see [this](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavOptimize/tree/main/1.17.1/mods). (Somehow Doregon ripped the old repo instead of just transferring ownership, sigh.)
- For 1.18.1/1.18.2: COMING SOON!

# Downloads
[The original repo](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavOptimize) doesn't have any releases, so I leave it here with my work for 1.17.1 (that has been abandoned, sorry). Just head to the Releases tab below and choose

### For 1.17.1
- The High variant: has Sodium.
- The Low variant: doesn't have Sodium.
